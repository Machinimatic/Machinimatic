-. Info;

- Coping-Link: Coping-Links comfort my insecurities and I often identify with them physically/psychologically in a way to comfort myself mentally, or how I view myself physically, it also extends further.

- I have severe anxiety & depression and can get overwhelmed easily
- I CANNOT sit still, I'm most likely doing multiple things at once..
- I lose motivation to do things quite frequently and often multitask when bored.
- I am active on socials & PonyTown, but I can disappear for awhile sometimes.
